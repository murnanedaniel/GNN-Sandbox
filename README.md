# Sandbox for GNN Architectures

This repository contains a collection of notebooks and automation scripts for designing GNN architectures (for particle track detection, ostensibly - though any datasets could be used) manually or via grid-scanning methods.

## Contents

- *[Sandbox.ipnb](Sandbox.ipynb)*: This is the main gateway to the design code. Contains interactive methods for generating and loading data, and designing architectures around this.
- *[/notebooks](/notebooks)*: Directory containing some concrete architectures. They are mostly for development of the repo itself.
